In other words: The simpliest yet experamental Qt browser for Ubuntu Touch.

**DISCLAIMER**: Many things do not work, <br>here is a TODO list sorted by priority:
- Tabs (important)
- ~~History (important)~~ 
- Bookmarks
- Camera and other permissions (not prioritized)

### Known Issues
Anchor to clipboard does not work

### Focal (20.04)
This program is developed for 16.04 base but there is an outdated focal branch.<br>
You can use the untested `focal.sh` script to fix library imports. Then try to compile with `clickable`. It might work.
