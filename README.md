# Octopus Browser

Browse the WWW like an octopus.
Features:
- Toggle JavaScipt On/Off
- Automatically load images On/Off
- Move address bar
- _MORE_

**DISCLAIMER**: Many things do not work, here is a TODO list sorted by priority:
- Tabs (important)
- History (important)
- Bookmarks
- Camera and other permissions (not prioritized)

In other words: The simpliest yet experamental Qt browser for Ubuntu Touch.

Note that the _focal_ branch is way **behind** the main branch (_xenial_)
